Aim of this project is to detect frontal human face using default camera on the computer and mark the face with a mark sign in case a movement has been detected. 
The idea has been inspired by the recent popular series on Netflix - Squid Game - red light green light.

Project uses OpenCV as the main library for video capture and display manipulation as well as the external Haar Cascade frontal face algorithm.
With the proper use of contouring and calculations done between single frame captured we are able to implement motion detection in the live feed.

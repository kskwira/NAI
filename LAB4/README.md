Project consists of 2 cases which both were resolved using SVM algorithms: \
<h4>Banknote Dataset </h4> \
The Banknote Dataset involves predicting whether a given banknote is authentic given a number of measures taken from a photograph.
It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 1,372 observations with 4 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

1. Variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
2. Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
3. Kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
4. Entropy of image (continuous).
5. Class (0 for authentic, 1 for inauthentic). \

The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 50%.

<b>For the calculations we used SVM with RBF kernel</b>

<h4>Qualitative Bankruptcy Data Set</h4> \
Predict the Bankruptcy from Qualitative parameters from experts for Companies in India.

The parameters which we used for collecting the dataset is referred from the paper 'The discovery of expertiseâ„¢ decision rules from qualitative bankruptcy data using genetic algorithms' by Myoung-Jong Kim*, Ingoo Han.
